# Facial Recognition Prototype

## Introduction

Facial recognition technologies are quickly becoming integrated into society:
* Facebook has the ability to automatically identify and tag our photos
* Apple integrate Face ID into some of their iPhones to authenticate a user
* Law enforcement and security companies are starting to integrate the tech into their products in order to identify people in surveillance videos (and in real-time)
* Advertising companies are beginning to use facial recognition to provide tailored ads

Whilst some of these companies are starting to integrate facial recognition into their products, the technology is still fairly new. Therefore, gaining first-hand experience at what the technology is capable of will help in knowing whether it is worth integrating into our products.

This article provides the results of my investigation into facial recognition. As well as this article, I have written a prototype that shows the capabilities of facial recognition. 

This article covers:
* Why are we investigating this tech?
* Basic facial recognition concepts
* Prototype features
* How it works
* Potential use cases
* Verdict
