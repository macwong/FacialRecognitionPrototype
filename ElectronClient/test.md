# Facial Recognition Prototype

## Introduction

Facial recognition technologies are currently integrated into various products and solutions:
* Facebook has the ability to automatically identify and tag our photos
* Apple integrate Face ID into some of their iPhones to authenticate a user
* Law enforcement and security companies integrate the tech into their products in order to identify people in surveillance videos (video recordings as well as real-time)
* Advertising companies are beginning to use facial recognition to provide tailored ads

Whilst some of these companies are starting to integrate facial recognition into their products, the technology is still fairly new. Therefore, investigating the capabilities of the tech will help in knowing whether it is worth integrating into our products.

This article provides the results of my investigation into facial recognition. As well as this article, I have written a prototype that shows the capabilities of facial recognition. 

This article covers:
* Why are we investigating this tech?
* Basic facial recognition concepts
* Prototype features
* How it works
* Potential use cases
* Verdict
* Next steps

## Why are we investigating this tech?

The aim of this investigation is to identify the feasibility of implementing facial recognition into our products. This includes:
* Measuring the accuracy of facial recognition predictions (including the sensitivity to variables such as different lighting conditions, facial positions and expressions)
* Finding out the threshold of how many people can be predicted upon before the system becomes too slow and / or inaccurate (e.g. identifying a person amongst 5, 50, 500 or even 5000 people)
* Testing the speed of predictions, to see if predictions can be made in real-time
* Checking whether we can identify people that the system doesn't know about, and possibly adding these people to the system on-the-fly
